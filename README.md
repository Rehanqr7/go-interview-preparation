# Go Interview Preparation

A comprehensive repository with Go code examples and explanations to help prepare for Go language interviews.

## Overview

This repository contains working code examples for essential Go concepts typically covered in interviews, along with explanatory comments and common interview questions.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following categories:

```

│   ├── variables_types/  # Variables, types, and constants
│   ├── control_flow/     # If, for, switch, defer
│   ├── functions/        # Functions, methods, closures
│   ├── structs_interfaces/ # Structs, interfaces, embedding
│   ├── error_handling/   # Error handling patterns
│   └── testing/          # Testing approaches
├── concurrency/          # Go's concurrency features
│   ├── goroutines_channels/ # Goroutines and channels
│   ├── sync_package/     # Sync primitives (Mutex, WaitGroup, etc.)
│   └── context/          # Context package
├── data-structures/      # Common data structures
│   ├── arrays_slices/    # Arrays and slices
│   └── maps/             # Maps and hash tables
├── algorithms/           # Common algorithms
└── mini-projects/        # Small projects demonstrating multiple concepts
    └── rest_api/         # Simple RESTful API
```

## How to Run Examples

Each example is contained in its own directory with a `main.go` file. To run a specific example, navigate to its directory and run:

```
cd basic-concepts/variables_types
go run main.go
```

## Topics Covered

### Basic Concepts
- Variables, types, and constants
- Control flow (if, for, switch, defer)
- Functions, methods, and closures
- Structs and interfaces
- Error handling patterns
- Testing approaches

### Concurrency
- Goroutines and channels
- Synchronization primitives
- Context package

### Data Structures
- Arrays and slices
- Maps and hash tables

### Mini-Projects
- RESTful API - Demonstrates web serving, JSON marshaling, concurrency, and more
